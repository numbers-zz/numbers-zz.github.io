		<p>Feynman diagrams are a common calculation technique in quantum and statistical field theory. They help organize large calculations by relating the structure of a calculation to the structure of a simple diagram, letting us draw out the terms we need to calculate. While we still have to <em>do</em> the calculation in the usual way, this makes it easier to keep track of all the pieces. The rules for describing Feynman diagrams are often presented as a bit mysterious, but they don’t have to be: the association of combinatorial structures to calculations has by now been fleshed out to a fairly general theory, to the point where it becomes trivial to read off the description of Feynman diagrams from the formula they describe.</p>

<p>In the following articles we’ll be following what’s known as \(\phi^4\)-theory, where the relationship between the rules and calculations is</p>

\[\underbrace{\vphantom{\frac g4}\exp}_{\text{Set}}
\underbrace{(\frac g{4!}\partial_J^4)}_{\substack{\text{replace 4 $J$s}\\\text{with a $g$}}}
\underbrace{\vphantom{\frac g4}\exp}_\text{Set}
\underbrace{\vphantom{\frac g4}(J^2/2m)}_{\substack{\text{$1/m$ and} \\ \text{Pair($J$)}}}\]

<p>In these articles we will build up the language needed to describe the systematic relationship between combinatorics and common physics calculations, in a way that hopefully clarifies where the various “Feynman rules” come from. But first, a bit of background:</p>

<h2 id="the-partition-function">The partition function</h2>

<p>In both quantum and statistical field theory we have a quantity called the <em>partition function</em> that we want to compute, that looks like (taking \(\phi^4\) theory as an example):</p>

\[Z[J]=\int e^{-\int \frac 12\phi^*\Delta\phi + \frac 12m\phi^2+\frac{g}{4!}\phi^4-J\phi dxdt}D\phi.\]

<p>Here I’ve chosen the statistical physics case so that I don’t have to carry around various factors of \(i\). If this expression isn’t clear, that’s fine: we’ll move to a simpler version shortly.</p>

<p>While this is a little bit abstract, many directly measurable quantities you might want to calculate are only a short step away from the partition function itself. So if you can do this one calculation then you’ve basically “solved” the theory! Unfortunately there’s no free lunch here, and doing this calculation is in general quite difficult. Luckily it <em>is</em> doable when \(g=0\) and the quartic contribution disappears, which corresponds to a theory of non-interacting particles. This insight leads us to do perturbation theory in \(g\), which is where the organization by Feynman diagrams is helpful.</p>

<p>Before getting into the diagrams themselves, let’s remove some clutter. First, the integral over spacetime on the inside of the exponential can go: the values of the field at different times are only linked in a “simple” way, through the first term (the Laplacian) and the core structure of Feynman diagrams is actually largely maintained if we focus on one isolated point. So instead of being a particle state or a field configuration, we’ll drop the Laplacian term and just take \(\phi\) to be a number. Second, this dramatically simplifies the path-integral surrounding the whole thing: integrating over \(\phi\) is just an ordinary integral. So the main calculation we’ll be investigating for awhile is just</p>

\[Z[J]=\int e^{-(\frac 12m\phi^2+\frac{g}{4!}\phi^4-J\phi)} d\phi.\]

<p>Much nicer.</p>

<h2 id="the-feynman-trick">The Feynman Trick</h2>

<p>A further trick for performing this calculation is to rewrite the \(\phi^4\)-term in a form that doesn’t depend on \(\phi\). This lets us bring it out to the front of the integral, which is then made solvable. The idea rests on the insight that \(\phi e^{J\phi}=\frac{d}{dJ}e^{J\phi}\), and that this is systematic: the operation of “multiply by \(\phi\)” is equivalent to a \(J\)-derivative when applied to \(e^{J\phi}\). Taking this through to <em>all</em> factors of \(\phi\) we can replace the \(\phi^4\) term completely and move it outside of the integral:</p>

\[\begin{align}&amp;\int e^{-(\frac 12m\phi^2+\frac{g}{4!}\phi^4-J\phi)}d\phi\\=&amp; \int e^{-\frac 12m\phi^2}e^{-\frac{g}{4!}\frac {d^4}{dJ^4}}e^{J\phi} d\phi\\= &amp;\hspace{3pt}e^{-\frac{g}{4!}\frac{d^4}{dJ^4}}\int e^{-\frac 12m\phi^2+J\phi} d\phi\end{align}\]

<p>What’s left is then a standard gaussian integral, which can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral#Generalizations">calculated</a> to give</p>

\[Z[J]=\frac 1{\sqrt{2\pi m}}e^{\frac{g}{4!}\frac {d^4}{dJ^4}}e^{J^2/2m}\]

<p>Going forward we will drop the \(m\)-prefactor, since for our purposes it’s just a constant that isn’t really relevant to the diagrams. At this point we’ve brought the partition function down into the form we saw at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-with-diagrams">Calculating with Diagrams</h2>

<p>Now that the partition function has been nicely reduced, we’ll talk a bit about how Feynman diagrams actually work. To perform a calculation with Feynman diagrams:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Draw all possible networks with a given number of vertices, whose structure depends on the theory. In the case of \(\phi^4\) theory, each vertex that isn’t a dangling leaf has four vertices.</li>
  <li>Associate an appropriate factor to each part of the diagram.</li>
  <li>Calculate the overall expression involving all of the factors, and multiply by a “symmetry factor”.</li>
  <li>Add up the contributions from all diagrams.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, here is one contribution to \(\phi^4\) theory:</p>

<figure class="post-image">
  <img src="/assets/images/feynman_intro_example.svg" alt="

    Replacing four J's with an interaction vertex.
" style="max-width: 100%" />
  <figcaption><p style="font-size: .9rem; text-align:center">Replacing four \(J\)'s with an interaction vertex.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that the right diagram is a valid diagram in the theory, since the only non-leaf vertex has four connections. This diagram contributes one \(g\) factor (for the single vertex), four \(J\) factors (for the four \(J\)’s) and four \(1/m\) factors (for the four edges). The diagram has three “types” of symmetries: one that swaps the two \(J\)’s in the isolated pair, one that swaps the two \(J\)’s sticking out of the boquet, and one that swaps the two half-edges in the loop. These can all be applied independently, so we have \(2^3=8\) symmetries overall (as the group \(\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\)). This gives a total contribution from this diagram of \(\frac 18 gJ^4/m^4\).</p>

<p>Not too bad, really. Each problem we get out of this is smaller/easier than our original problem, and we can figure out exactly which sub-problems we need just by drawing diagrams. There are tons of diagrams to draw, but we’ll see later how to trim that number down a bit: the diagrams aren’t independent of each other. But why should we be so lucky? Why should that first messy calculation be describable by <em>pictures</em> at all?</p>

<p>In the next article we’ll see how the <em>symbolic method</em> in combinatorics answers these questions.</p>
